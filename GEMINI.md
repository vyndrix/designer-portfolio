Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.

## Project Structure & Conventions

### Directory Layout
- `src/components/ui`: shadcn-ui base components.
- `src/components`: Application-specific components (e.g., `entity-table`, `skills-section`).
- `src/pages`: Page components organized by route (Home, Dashboard, Login).
- `src/remote`: Backend integration layer, including Supabase client, query providers, and hooks.
- `src/theme`: Theme configuration and provider (supporting dark/light modes).
- `src/lib`: Shared utilities and helpers.

### Development Conventions
- **Routing:** Uses `HashRouter` for compatibility with static hosting environments.
- **Backend Integration:** All Supabase interactions should go through `src/remote`. Use the `sb` export (Supabase client) and TanStack Query for data fetching.
- **Styling:** Adhere to Tailwind CSS v4 conventions. Use CSS variables defined in `src/styles.css` for consistent spacing, colors, and shadows.
- **Forms:** Use `react-hook-form` paired with `zod` schemas for validation.
- **Components:** Favor composition and small, reusable components. Use `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for class manipulation.
- **Types:** Run `yarn db:types` after making schema changes in Supabase to keep `src/remote/database.types.ts` up to date.
